# Custom Terrain Material Blend Shader

This custom shader has been meticulously crafted using Shader Graph in Unity, purpose-built to enhance the visual appeal of 3D Terrains. It seamlessly integrates two distinct materials, with one serving as the primary texture and the other as an overlay, offering the flexibility to adjust the opacity of the overlay material as needed.
